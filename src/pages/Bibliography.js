                <BibEntry citation={<span>Berry, Jennifer Ann.<wbr/> &quot;LGBTQ+ Representation in Young Children's Television: A Qualitative Research Study.<wbr/>&quot; University of Southern California, 2022.<wbr/> https:/<wbr/>/<wbr/>www.<wbr/>proquest.<wbr/>com/<wbr/>dissertations-<wbr/>theses/<wbr/>lgbtq-<wbr/>representation-<wbr/>young-<wbr/>children-<wbr/>s-<wbr/>television/<wbr/>docview/<wbr/>2670142760/<wbr/>se-<wbr/>2.<wbr/></span>} anno1="Representation of characters in kids' animation affects their socialization and social identity acceptance but the U.S. animation includes very little representation of LGBTQ+ (especially under the age of 10). Providing a more dynamic representation on tv shows allows kids to form healthy identiy formation, better understand cultures, and develop empathy towards others. The lack of representation of LGBTQ+ in animation indicates the support of heteronormativity of the content creators and decision makers in kids' animation industry, which contributes to depression, bullying or drug abuse from the youth." anno2="According to Berry, the owners of large tv networks are large organizational conglomerates, who focus more on making shows targeting children from age 2 to 7. However, older children have more access to such diverse contents. The production of characters heavily rely on the approval of decision-making executives since the content creators all want “greenlit” from them, which means they care more about whether the shows are allowed to be aired, rather than the educational values they hold towards the children. “Many LGBTQ+ youth do not have real-life examples and role models from the LGBTQ+ community.”. Therefore,  lacks of representation of characters that may work as demonstrations and tools to educate them, they are put in high risks of family rejection, mental problems, self-harm and suicidal thoughts." anno3="Various experiments and studies show television programmings have great influence over children academically, whether they are postive or negative depending on hours of watching, age, or parental involvement. Moreover, the amount of interaction with television and digital devices in general affects their physical and mental health, as well as their social interaction. A study address that thanks to the representation of diverse characters in television shows, social belonging and tolerance have increased. However, since such topics are considered too sensitive to children by a group of dominant ideologies, who view kids as vulnerable “too young”, and stirred controversy, leading to canceltation, it discourages the production team to continue including these characters in the shows." anno4="As Berry conducts research, she finds that many content creators and decision makers lack knowledge or ways to build a well-represented representation of LGBTQ+ characters despite their awareness of their important roles in the shows. Also, they are more open to other fields of diversity, such as race, ethnicity, or gender but not LGBTQ+ as they view the topic too controversial, which can affect the possibility of their shows getting “greenlit”. The pressure from stakeholders as well as the little value they can get from creating the representation of LGBTQ+ characters prevent them from appearing in more children's television shows."/>

Their findings, in broad strokes, find that LGBT-inclusive marketing tends to outperform its LGBT-themed counterpart, a phenomenon which Cheng et al attribute to the mass appeal to both LGBT-oriented and LGBT-opposed focus groups, as the &quot;inclusive&quot; media is easily editable such that bigoted groups are able to consume the content in an edited form, i.e. censored international releases. This troubling phenomenon is in stark contrast to the erstwhile impression of more widespread LGBT acceptance and representation that media firms believe. It should be mentioned, however, that this study is stated at the outset to be market research for how to broaden appeal of queer marketing, and thus can be said to have an ulterior motive."/>

The thesis provides data on the increasing number of queer characters in media as well as the public reception to those characters by describing surveys taken by undergraduate students. There is a recurring trend where people who watch shows with queer characters are more likely to acknowledge queer relationships as normal. Moreover, the thesis also analyzes the type of queer representation being shown in shows, concluding that LGBT characters are often depicted holding hands or hugging. This paper offers useful numerical data points that we can use to enhance our analysis. However, the thesis does not draw any additional conclusions beyond a statistical analysis of the prevalance of queer representation in media."/>

Through in-depth interviews with nineteen LGBTQ youth in a large urban Canadian city, Craig investigates the impact of LGBTQ media on their mental health. Overall, the interviewees claimed that LGBTQ media contributed positively to their wellbeing and sense of resilience by allowing them to cope through escapism; by empowering them via positive and resilient LGBT story lines; and by fostering a sense of community (with other consumers of LGBTQ media). This study relates to our research in that it emphasizes the motivation and importance of our research question: How has LGBTQ representation across US animated shows expanded in the past decades? The fact that LGBTQ media (including animation) has real-life impacts on the wellbeing of LGBTQ individuals is precisely why it is important to investigate whether media, including animated shows, have shifted to incorporate more positive LGBTQ representation. One critique of this study is that it focuses on a very small population of LGBTQ individuals in a very specific environment in urban Canada. As a result, the study results cannot necessarily be generalized to other LGBTQ youth communities."/>

The article explores the history of LGBTQ censorship and silences in the 1950s, where constitutional rights didn’t apply to LGBTQ people in which they weren’t allowed to be business owners or protest, and widespread seizures of LGBTQ publications. This article relates to our research as we build a timeline and map out significant LGBTQ events in the United States that correspond with the booming movement in LGBTQ media in the 21st century. We can use this journal to support whether there is a correlation between significant moments for LGBTQ rights and the quality of queer representations in animated shows that were released around the same time period. One critique of this article is the possible overgeneralization of particular events, where extra research might be needed to fully understand the events mentioned, as well as specific dates and locations for mapping."/>
                <BibEntry citation={<span>Drushel, Bruce E.<wbr/> 2020.<wbr/> “Of Letters and Lists: How the MPAA Puts Films Recommended for LGBTQ Adolescents Out of Reach.<wbr/>” Journal of Homosexuality 67 (2): 174–88.<wbr/> https://<wbr/>doi.<wbr/>org/<wbr/>10.<wbr/>1080/<wbr/>00918369.<wbr/>2018.<wbr/>1528072.<wbr/></span>} anno1="Film rating has been modified multiple times after its creation. MPAA was found to approve R rating films from major studios more often than independent filmmakers. Also, films rating at PG and PG-13 earned much more than R rating ones. The author argued that despite the awareness of the heavy influence of LGBTQ+ characters on adolescents, the portrayal was prevented by the restriction of parents and censorship from the film industry. According to Coyle, the appearance of such characters in the youth’s shows were very low, with only 2% of about 400 films includes queer characters, and 0.06% are transgenders. Furthermore, queer sexuality is strictly probihited. Studies state that many works that were rated NC-17 (no audiences below 17 years old) included similar if not less explicit scenes than those R rating that contained sexual interactions between heterosexual characters. About half of the films in seven lists recommended for LGBTQ+ adolescents which was provided by Google and Bing were unrated by MPAA. It means they were from independent filmmakers or were not submitted for evaluation due to many reasons, in which one of them is probably to avoid restriction, and interestingly quite a few of them were rated R and PG or PG-13. Rating is essential to the films’ potential to approach adolescents, since restricted rating such as R and NC-17 prevented the children from accessing, while unrated films have lower chances to approach them due to not being booked by exhibitors, DVDs not being sold by many retailers, or not being aired by television channels."/>

The analysis found that programs on cable networks were more likely to feature LGBTQ content than those aired on commercial broadcast networks. The analysis also found that programs in the “childrens cartoons” and “talk shows” genre were consistently low in LGBTQ representation whereas programs in the “variety/comedy” and “feature film” genre had the highest proportions of LGBTQ content. This study relates to several of our research questions, primarily (1) Why do certain genres have more queer representation than others? — but, also (2) What percentage of series were produced in large as opposed to small corporate studios? This study gives us insight into which genres and which networks tend to feature LGBTQ content for all TV shows, but not for the specific subgroup of animated shows. Thus, we may not be able to generalize the exact statistics and conclusions drawn in the study to our research."/>

Inspiring growth and inclusion, the authors also provide strategies to help the readers better communicate with people who are trans and nonbinary. Moreover, chapters offer insight into changes and shifts in our perception of gender identities by providing a history of transgender activism. The experiences of gender non-conforming individuals vary due to intersections with other parts of one's identity, such as race and economic status. This book can inform us on the numerous landmark events of queer history in the United States."/>

He emphasizes a thorough foundation in the history of representation, patterns of genre, and prevalent queer stereotypes is vital to making informed writing choices. The article traces historical trends, analyzing different methods of representation varying from humanistic and sensitive in the drama genre which provide visibility to the difficult lives queer people face in an intolerant society, as well as harmful and abnormalizing in the comedy genre that abuses queer stereotypes as a humor device. Finding a balance between queer lives and social issues, he emphasizes multidimensionality of queer characters and not centering their character around their queerness which can adversely perpetuate queer as “abnormal”. This journal can provide historical context to the queer representations in our dataset and illustrates trends in genre and explicit/implicit representation that can explain why certain animated shows had better receptions than others. One critique about this article is its focus on queer representations solely in Western cinema and culture, as well as focusing too much on gay and lesbian representations and lack of discussions on trangender and transsexual representations."/>

In a case study of lesbian fans of Xena: Warrior Princess, Hanmer analyzes how otherwise heterosexual-presenting women were able to engage in a process of self-discovery thanks to the homosexual subtext of the show. Through the establishment of intimate relationships in online subcommunities, Hanmer argues that the themes of self-determination and self-exploration provide viewers with a framework with which they can empathize, such that their own self-discovery is catalyzed in the process."/>

Television’s lack of movie blockbuster glamor is what exactly contributes to its impact as a normalizer for the portrayal of queer characters. It allows the average viewer to become used to the presence of queer individuals and thus begins to assimilate queerness into civil society. However, what does that mean for queerness, which is defined as the subversion of the ordinary, becoming ordinary? Joyrich explores these questions by analyzing the impact of shows like Glee and Modern Family on American audiences. This source is useful for our research because it offers unique insights on the effect queer representation in media has on audiences. However, this source focuses exclusively on live action shows which may have a different impact on audiences than animated shows do."/>

Researching American television, Kelso finds that there is limited portrayal of characters who are gender-nonconforming children in the United States. Those rare depictions that do exist misrepresents these identities by fixating on negative experiences of gender dysphoria. Thus, young children exploring their gender identity may grow up isolated with aversion or fear to this crucial part of themselves. The article does explore how different mediums have been more progressive in this direction, showcasing children that behave against gender norms. At the same time, cultural impact is limited because younger generations can only access these resources (e.g., books) through their parents. We can use this article to address the lack of representation and misrepresentation of certain identities within the LGBTQIA+ community in American animated television series. It is worth noting that while the article defines several gender identities, it fails to cover nonbinary folk."/>

This article outlines important conversations into the challenges behind airing shows with LGBTQ+ representation. Sugar, who is known to include a lot of metaphors and references to queer relationships through the symbolic use of her genderless mythical aliens called crystal gems, discusses how Cartoon Network studios was unaware of the queer experiences that were aired on the show (since most staff was dominated by heteronormativity, and Sugar herself identified as part of the queer community) until fans pointed them out when it aired. Sugar was told to not publicly speak about LGBTQ+ references in her work from 2012 up until 2016, where there had been more advancements in LGBTQ+ rights. Such experiences like this are vital in helping us understand the limitations creators face when including LGBTQ+ characters and support our thesis as to how LGBTQ+ representation has transformed. One critique of this article is how it only represents show creators behind major media corporations (Cartoon Network and Dreamworks), and we can’t generalize some of these experiences to creators of shows in our dataset that belonged to smaller corporations."/>

This term is a portmanteau of &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;mainstream,&quot; and Ng explains that in attempting to make LGBT-oriented content which has mainstream appeal, Logo has reduced the specificity of television programming and, in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience of non-LGBT consumers, has effectively lessened LGBT representation in the process. For example, Ng identifies RuPaul's Drag Race as an example of this phenomenon, with Logo TV's internal documents and discussions reflecting an attempt to appeal to more heterosexual women under the pretense that their tastes in media are aligned with that of gay men, a trend that is argues is harmful to lesbians, who are overlooked in this process. Overall, her argument is that simply representing LGBT identities in media programming may not profer true &quot;representation&quot; of queer communities and cultures, and that there exist alternatives to shows designed for mass-appeal and commodification of the LGBT community."/>

Pitman analyzes a variety of recent children’s media that include LGBTQ+ themes and their impact on contemporary culture and society. Pitman finds that these shows normalize the existence of different sexualities and gender identities, turning the historic shame and stigma towards LGBTQ+ representations into mainstream culture. She notes recent queer cartoons include themes about found-family, addressing how all families are special and queer people shouldn’t feel a need to fit themselves into the classic nuclear family. One critique is the article doesn’t account for adult animated shows which are also in our dataset. However, this can support our thesis in examining whether there is a correlation between the age of a show and the number of queer characters, assessing trends in whether queer characters have come to occupy more visible roles in recent years."/>

The increasing presence of queer representation in media and society as a whole has incentivized corporations to commodify queer identities (ie Pride month promotions) for the sake of improving their bottom lines. Commodification also creates an image of an “acceptable” queer that is unique enough to be marketed to but not unique enough to be distasteful to a general audience, thus ironically homogenizing the very idea of queerness. Even if it is not specific to media representation, it offers vital insights on the relationship between queer representation and capitalism. The study, however, does not specifically address our project topic and is from the 1990’s meaning that it lacks important context like the mass proliferation of the internet and social media."/>
